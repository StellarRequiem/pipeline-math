# Solution: the frozen statements, proven (clean, named results)

`Theorems.lean` holds the immutable *spec* (each theorem is `:= sorry`). This file
restates each of those statements **verbatim** in the `Prob30c.Solution` namespace
and proves it with the corresponding sorry-free `*_proof` declaration from
`Proofs/`. Each `:= …_proof` typechecks only if the proof has *exactly* the frozen
proposition, so this file is simultaneously the no-drift certificate and the
clean, named result that `verify.sh` audits via
`#print axioms Prob30c.Solution.<name>`.

SETUP-stage stub: no proofs exist yet (all frozen statements are `sorry`), so the
ten restated theorems are added by the Wrap/Discharge agent as each proof lands.
This file must stay `sorry`-free and compile.
