# Discharge: each frozen theorem is proven by its `Proofs/` counterpart

The frozen `Theorems.lean` holds the immutable *statements* (as `sorry`). The
real proofs live in `Proofs/` as `*_proof` declarations. Once a frozen theorem
is proved, this file adds an `example : @Frozen = @Proof := rfl`, which compiles
**iff** the proven version has *exactly* the frozen proposition — a
machine-checked guarantee that no statement drifted and nothing was weakened.

SETUP-stage stub: no proofs exist yet (all frozen statements are `sorry`), so the
no-drift `rfl` gates are added by the Wrap/Discharge agent. This file must stay
`sorry`-free and compile.
